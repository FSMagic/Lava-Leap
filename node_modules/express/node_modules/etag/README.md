Create simple ETags

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install etag
```

## API

```js
var etag = require('etag')
```

### etag(entity, [options])

Generate a strong ETag for the given entity. This should be the complete
body of the entity. Strings, `Buffer`s, and `fs.Stats` are accepted. By
default, a strong ETag is generated except for `fs.Stats`, which will
generate a weak ETag (this can be overwritten by `options.weak`).

```js
res.setHeader('ETag', etag(body))
```

#### Options

`etag` accepts these properties in the options object.

##### weak

Specifies if a "strong" or a "weak" ETag will be generated. The ETag can only
really be a strong as the given input.

## Testing

```sh
$ npm test
```

## Benchmark

```bash
$ npm run-script bench
